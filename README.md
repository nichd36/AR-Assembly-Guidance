# Final Year Project (Report File Name: NicholasD_FYP_pdf.pdf)

## AR Enabled Assembly Guidance System

In order to alleviate the problems in training new assemblers, an AR-enabled guiding system for assembling and training processes can be implemented. It offers extra visualization for guidelines, enabling workers to learn how to assemble products more effectively. Resulting in enhanced understanding, reduced errors and expenses at the same time. By adopting AR-enabled guiding system, manufacturing industries can streamline the onboarding process for new assemblers and upskill existing assemblers. With the availability of smartphones nowadays this system can be easily accessible by the assemblers.
